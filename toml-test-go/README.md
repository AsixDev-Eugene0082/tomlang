# Implements the TOML test suite interface

This is an implementation of the interface expected by
[toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test) for my
[toml parser written in Go](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml).
In particular, it maps TOML data on `stdin` to a JSON format on `stdout`.

Compatible with commit bba544f4fc9fcb9af2a1c7abf4bce17e4ea426a0
